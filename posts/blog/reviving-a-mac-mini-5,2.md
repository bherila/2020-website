You might have some trouble with this one


* Installing Windows 10 results in a black screen because Windows 10 does not support Intel HD Graphics 3000 and there is no driver available 

Your options are:

* MacOS - an old, unsupported version, not ideal! You could try OpenCore but people say newer MacOS versions don't work well on this particular Mac Mini. Plus it's arguably against the EULA?
* Ubuntu?
* ChromeOS?
