ingredients:
  - Bones from 4-6 chicken thighs (after deboning)
  - 8 cups water
  - 1 large Asian carrot, peeled and cut into 1-inch cubes

Warning: Be sure to peel any tough, thick outer skin from the daikon radish before cutting in cubes!

Simmer chicken thigh bones in 8 cups of water for 30 minutes, skimming any foam, to make a homemade chicken stock.

Strain the stock and return to the pot. Discard bones.

Add carrot and daikon cubes to the stock. Simmer for 20-30 minutes until vegetables are tender.

Stir in Lee Kum Kee chicken bouillon powder to taste for saltiness and umami. Adjust salt as needed.

Serve hot, garnished with chopped scallions if desired.
