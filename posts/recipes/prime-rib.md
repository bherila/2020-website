Trim excess fat from the ribeye roast. You want to leave some fat as this will form a crust.

Combine kosher salt, pepper, thyme to make a dry rub.

Rub the ribeye roast with the mixture.

Leave this in the refrigerator to dry out for 1-2 days.

Let the roast come up to room temp for at least 3-4 hours.

Roast at 275 (F) degree oven until internal temp is 120 (F).

No need to rest. Slice and serve immediately.

Tip: Use warm plates to prevent from getting cold at serving time.
