Note: Gai-lan, also known as Chinese broccoli, is a leafy green vegetable with thick stems and a slightly bitter, earthy flavor.

Heat oil in a large skillet or wok over medium-high heat.

Add minced garlic and Thai chili, stir-fry for 30 seconds until fragrant.

Add gai-lan and toss to coat in the oil and aromatics.

Add water, cover, and steam for 2-3 minutes until gai-lan is bright green and just tender.

Uncover, add soy sauce and sugar, and stir-fry for another 1-2 minutes until liquid is mostly evaporated and gai-lan is crisp-tender.

Season with salt to taste. Serve immediately.
