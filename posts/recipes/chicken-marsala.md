Slice chicken breasts in half horizontally to make 4 thin cutlets. Pound to even thickness if needed.

Mix flour, salt, and pepper in a shallow dish. Dredge chicken cutlets in the flour mixture, shaking off excess.

Heat 2 tablespoons olive oil and 1 tablespoon butter in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add chicken and cook 3-4 minutes per side until golden and just cooked through. Remove to a plate and tent with foil.

Add remaining 1 tablespoon olive oil and 1 tablespoon butter to the skillet. Add mushrooms and cook, stirring, until browned and their liquid has evaporated, about 5 minutes. Add garlic and cook 30 seconds more.

Pour in Marsala wine and scrape up any browned bits. Simmer for 2 minutes to reduce slightly. Add chicken broth and simmer another 3-4 minutes until sauce thickens a bit.

Return chicken and any juices to the pan. Simmer 2-3 minutes, spooning sauce over chicken, until heated through.

Stir in remaining 1 tablespoon butter for a silky sauce. Garnish with parsley if desired. Serve immediately.
