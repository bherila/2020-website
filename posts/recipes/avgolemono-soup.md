In your soup pot, saute finely-diced onion and celery until fragrant and soft.

Mix the eggs into cold chicken stock so they don't cook right away.

Gently add the egg mixture and the uncooked orzo pasta and stir until everything is hot and the pasta is cooked. Allow the soup to cool slightly and squeeze fresh lemon juice just prior to serving.

You can (optionally) add some shredded chicken breast meat.
