Blanch the bean sprouts: Place the bean sprouts in a wire skimming ladle and dip them into hot broth for no more than 15 seconds. Drain well.

In a bowl, combine the oyster sauce, soy sauce, water, sugar, white pepper, chicken powder (or dashi powder), and a splash of rice vinegar if using. Mix well.

Toss the blanched bean sprouts with the sauce, spring onions, fried garlic, and fried onion. Add the finely sliced shiso leaves and a drizzle of toasted sesame oil. Sprinkle with toasted sesame seeds.

Serve immediately, garnished with extra shiso and sesame seeds if desired.
