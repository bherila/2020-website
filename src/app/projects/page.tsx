            I like to cook, a lot. Lately, I&apos;ve focused mostly on Asian cuisine. However, I also love european cuisine,
            especially my own heritage, Italian, cooking, and French. Since friends have asked, I&apos;m posting some
            recipes and cooking tips online.

            As co-founder and CTO at Underground Cellar, I grew the engineering team and own the internal products used by
            the company, spanning frontend, backend, administrative interface, and mobile apps for iOS and Android
            platforms. I also work with the CEO and major investors to design and implement financial models and reports. As
            a board director, I worked with investors and shape the governance of the company.
