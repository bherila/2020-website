        <h1>Mentoring</h1>
        <p>I have a long history of mentorship, both as mentor and mentee. This is an important part of my life and my career development. I actively seek mentoring relationships.</p>
        <p>Ideas for discussion</p>
        <ol start="1" role="list">
          <li>what does it take to form a successful mentoring program</li>
          <li>what are the differences between mentoring at a small company vs. large company vs. not at a company</li>
          <li>discuss my personal mentoring experiences and what I learned from them</li>
        </ol>
        <p>‍</p>
        <h2>Underground Cellar</h2>
        <p>As the CTO, many members of the team looked up to me. I served primarily as a mentor in this capacity. Regularly scheduled 1-1 meetings (not just with my direct reports, but also with my peers and the CEO) provided a natural mentoring environment. I also recommended educational resources to coworkers looking to expand their skill sets. For example, one of our customer support associates has become very good with SQL, so I ensure she can get the help and support (and training) she needs.</p>
        <p>As a Y Combinator Founder &amp; CTO, I had the opportunity to participate in various speaking opportunities. For example, I gave a talk at <a href="https://www.founder.university/">Founder.university</a> in November 2018 to startup CEOs about the CTO role and what it takes to transition from a proof of concept idea to a tech company.</p>
        <p>I have also had the opportunity to participate in panel groups such as LAUNCH Incubator sessions to work with startup founders on crafting their messaging</p>
        <p>I am also open to meet-ups with people who <a href="contact.html">reach out</a> to me and want to discuss some technology, startups, fundraising, or other topic over coffee.</p>

        <h2>Microsoft</h2>
        <p>When I worked at Microsoft I participated in a rotational mentorship program that focused on career development and working in a larger corporation. I was taken on as a mentee by a seasoned Program Manager Director and I also had the opportunity to mentor college interns and new hires while at Microsoft. I remain in contact with many of those individuals today.</p>

        <h2>Brown University</h2>
        <p>I have extensive TA experience from my time at Brown University. As Head TA, I had the opportunity to mentor not only the students in the course but also the TAs who were holding office hours and labs alongside me. There was a significant amount of 1-1 time with the professor of each course which also helped me to learn to be a better mentor.</p>
