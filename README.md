## This is my personal website

Figured I'd make the repo public because there are lots of goodies inside. Some of these goodies include:

* Tax optimization worksheet
* Stock price min/max thing
* My website
* Some recipes? Coming soon?

BTW this was created with a starter kit:

```
yarn create next-app --example with-typescript-eslint-jest with-typescript-eslint-jest-app
```

NextJS site hosted on Vercel (thanks for the awesome service!!)
